        It appears this doesn't expand environment variables, so in fact
        is creating a path containing a $, which breaks all sorts of
        things, and definitely isn't necessary. Hopefully relative
        paths will fix this (but there's no way to tell other than
        PRing)

        The only difference is that v3 drops support for old JS engines, and
        this is slightly awkward in other places where we're testing with
        phantomjs. Would be nice to update those places eventually, but for now
        this is the far easier short-term fix.
