Modifying settings
------------------

This module is intended to only provide *read only* access to the settings. Balena settings client reads settings from various locations, like a local `balenarc` file and a per user `config` file, therefore the module doesn't know where to write changes back.

If you want to persist data related to balena, consider using [balena settings storage](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/balena-settings-storage) instead.
